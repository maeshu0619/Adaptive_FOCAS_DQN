# Adaptive FOCAS DQN/Custom Environment

**Introduction**

This repository provides a framework for creating custom environments using OpenAI Gym and applying Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to solve them. 

**Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maeshu0619/Adaptive_FOCAS_DQN.git
   ```
   
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   
**Creating a Custom Environment**

To create a custom environment, you'll need to subclass the `gym.Env` class and implement the following methods:

```python
class YourCustomEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize environment parameters
        ...

    def reset(self):
        # Reset environment to initial state
        ...
        return observation

    def step(self, action):
        # Execute action and get next state, reward, done, info
        ...
        return next_observation, reward, done, info

    def render(self):
        # Render the environment
        ...
```
